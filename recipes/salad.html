        <p>This is of course not a hard and fast instructional. 
            Everyone has different tastes in salad and I bow to that. 
            Maybe you like yours with a creamy dressing; maybe you 
            like yours super assertive like Amanda Hessers anchovy-
            spiked vinaigrette. Maybe you like to always have extra 
            vegetables in your salad or, like me, you just want to 
            keep it ultra-simple</p>
        <p>ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About 4 ounces lettuce or mixed greens, washed, 
                dried, and torn</li>
            <li>Finely shredded carrots or julienned cucumbers 
                (optional)</li>
            <li>Small handful finely shredded fresh basil, mint or 
                other aromatic herb (optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vinegar or lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup</li>
            <li>Flaky salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan or Asiago cheese, for garnish 
                (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>equipent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>large bowl</li>
            <li>cup</li>
            <li>whisk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps you can follow to make a salad:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the greens and spin dry if you like, then lay 
                them out on a towel to air-dry for a little while</li>
            <li>Tear up your greens if you think they will be too 
                big to spear and eat gracefully</li>
            <li>No matter how you serve your salad, it's best to toss 
                it in a really big bowl much bigger than the volume 
                of the green themselves</li>
            <li>Here I added about 1/3 cup grated carrot (I didn't 
                peel the carrot, and I grated it straight into the 
                salad) and a small handful chiffonaded basil</li>
            <li>For this salad dressing, whisk 2 tablespoons good 
                olive oil with 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar until 
                thick and emulsified</li>
            <li>Whisk in 1/2 teaspoon honey and blend</li>
            <li>Taste the dressing and adjust as needed</li>
            <li>Drizzle the salad very lightly with dressing, just 
                enough to moisten the lettuce, and work it in with 
                your hands or two forks, stopping to toss it before 
                you add all the dressing you've made. You want to 
                coat the greens very, very lightly</li>
            <li>As you toss the salad with your hands or forks, 
                sprinkle on salt and pepper. Taste and adjust as 
                needed</li>
            <li>Serve the salad in individual bowls, or on plates. 
                Garnish with some pepper, a shaving of cheese, or 
                some fruit or nuts</li>
        </ol>
